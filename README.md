# ReputationScheme_P2P
A simple model of a dencentralised, P2P network to examine how the number of shares varies when reputation-based schemes are deployed in an effort to overcome the freeriding problem.

I made this just for fun because I wanted to experiment with SimPy, and employ coding techniques I've learnt through online courses, including OOP. I thought it would be fun to do this via a topic I just recently started reading up on - game theory in computer science. 

I was inspired by articles on the freeriding problem in P2P networks - when a user does not contribute to the network and simply downloads content. If everyone did this on the network...not good. There have been reputation-based schemes employed so that users have to maintain a good reputation in order to still download content from the network, and to get a good reputation: well, you have to share! Sharing is caring.

(This isn't a model of an actual P2P network with it's protocols - rather the idea of a P2P network where users interact directly with other users and share/download resources.)
